> Depend on `MapoboxNavigation 1.3.0`

# Feature

- Include the option to input multiple coordinates up to a maximum of 25, as Mapbox can only handle 25 waypoints at once.
- To designate certain points as "SilentWaypoints" where the driver does not need to stop, create a "whitelist" property. By default, all points are designated as stoppage points, but this array allows other points to be specified as "SilentWaypoints."
- Include a "delay" property, which would enable the user to listen at specific time intervals. By default, it listens every second.

## Available property

- **isSimulationEnable** `boolean` We can test the navigation functionality during development by passing certain parameters.
- **onError** `Function` This function is called when an error occurs.
- **onEvent** `Function` usable for debugging
- **onNavigationCancelled** `Function` This function is called when the user cancels navigation by either pressing the close icon on the bottom bar or from the Notification tray.
- **onDestinationArrival** `Function` called once user arrived at final waypoint
- **onLocationChange** `Function` This function is called every second and returns the current user location along with additional details.
- **mute** `boolean` To mute navigation speech, a property can be set to true, with false being the default.
- **navigationMode** `String` The mode can be used for different types of transportation, such as walking, cycling, or driving. The default mode is driving
- **language** `String` A property can be used to change the navigation language, with `en` being the default.
- **waypoints** `Waypoint` Dictionary of coordinate
